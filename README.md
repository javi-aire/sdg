Coding Assessment -- Javier Williams

## description
##### Requested mock as a webpage in this repo
###### I chose to work with jQuery (cdn <script> at end of body) and Sass

## installation
1. Clone the repo then in your CLI:
2. > npm install
3. > gulp

Browser-sync will inform you of the port, and you should be all set!

Hope to hear from y'all soon.

### FYI
-- See notes in sdg.js if complications occur.
